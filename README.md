# ðŸ§  AI-Powered SQL Agent Chatbot ðŸ¤–

Interact with your SQL databases using natural language!

---

## ðŸš€ Overview

This project is an **AI-driven SQL Agent Chatbot** built with **Streamlit** and **LangChain**, enabling users to query SQL databases using natural languageâ€”no manual SQL writing required. Whether you're working with a local SQLite database or a remote MySQL instance, this tool provides seamless, conversational access to your data.

---

## ðŸŽ¬ Demo Database

The chatbot uses a sample movies SQL database with the following tables:

- **actors**
- **financials**
- **languages**
- **movie_actor**
- **movies**

This rich schema supports a wide range of test queries and demonstrates the chatbotâ€™s ability to handle real-world scenarios.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features

- **Flexible Database Connectivity**  
  Easily switch between local SQLite and remote MySQL connections.

- **Natural Language to SQL**  
  Utilizes OpenAI's language models via LangChain to intelligently translate questions into SQL queries.

- **Streamlit-Powered UI**  
  Clean, real-time chat interface for interactive data exploration.

- **Dynamic Query Execution**  
  Parses user input, constructs SQL queries, and returns results instantly.

- **Robust Error Handling**  
  Handles SQL parsing or execution errors gracefully for a smooth user experience.
